The location of this hotel and very decent price makes this an amazing deal. When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.\n\nThe hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.\n\nI would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.\n\nDas Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.\nUnser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.\nSonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.\n\nIm gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.\n\nDie Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.\n\nDas Frühstück für 9,50 GBP \/ Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.\n\nFür ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen. \n\n\n----\n[1] http:\/\/www.yelp.de\/biz\/motel-one-edinburgh-2?hrid=7UDwl3s_DuOokkGPZXZgBw","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. \n\nMotel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69\/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.\n\nLocation is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.\n\nMy room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. \n\nRandom: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used.

One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.\n\nI placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken\/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................\n\nChicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.\n\nSesame Chicken\/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak\/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!\n\nEgg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.\n\nDeep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  \n\nOverall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.

Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. \n\nWith Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?","useful":8,"funny":4,"cool":6}

There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates \"Flows,\" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3}

The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place.

The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.    \n\nThe chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.  \n\nI'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.  Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak.

(one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of \"well then what the hell is he complaining about\").\n\nthe vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.\n\ni enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.\n\nall my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.\n\nI found myself here ordering the much touted \"Hot Balls\" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the \"Diver Scallops\" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the \"Leg of Lamb\" and \"Wild Stripped Bass\" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. \n\nThe Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. \n\nOverall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.\n\nI hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles.

Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. \n\nStill, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.\n\nAnd once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his \"little neglected table.\" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.\n\nFood-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the \"shared food\" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. \n\nRich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a \"sugo\" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.\n\nAlongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained \"sauce & balls\" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were \"al dente\" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.\n\nWines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's \"Anna 6\" white was very dry and very refreshing. \n\nIn addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was \"out\" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.\n\nTotal cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.\nThis would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.\n\nI would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Yes.\n\nIs that enough for me to give it five stars? No.\n\nI've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.\n\nWhy? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.\n\nThe dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French\/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as \"Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue\"?! \n\nAgain I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. \n\nThankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion. \n\nThis restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.\n\nWent to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.\n\nFood:\nThe server\/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.\n\nTo start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. \n\nFor my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.\n\nMy date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. \n\nWe contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.\n\nOnly main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly\/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.\n\nNot sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.\n\nOverall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I couldn't get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is. \n\nAnd obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty. \n\nMaybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion.

That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.\n\nI wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.\n\nThe kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.\n\nA meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.\n\nI've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.\n\n\nOysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.\n\nWe opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.\n\nFor our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).\n\nThe Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit \"salad\" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.\n\nOur dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.\n\nSide dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.\n\nAs with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.\n\nThe message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.\n\nOur meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. \n\nI can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. \n\nSpecials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). \n\nWe started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. \n\nI opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. \n\nWe passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. \n\nAnd so it goes...\n\n I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. \n\nThe service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. \n\nThe food? It was good, but forgetable (don't hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. \n\nLike the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it's a must order. Even if you don't like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). \n\nWe also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. \n\nI know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3}

The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. \n\nDiver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guanciale\nI liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. \n\nEntrée:\n\nHaddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish\nPerhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough. \n\nDessert:\n\nLemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom! \n\nIn the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here.

I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!).  But, they did not.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand....

After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.\n\nService was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.\n\nIt happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.\n\nOn a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.\n\nFor dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.\n\nI'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first.

I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. \n\nI ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.\n\nSteak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection.

It is amazing! \n\nBetween four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!!

There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!) \n\nThe location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies.

It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun).

Nice 50's decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which \"chips\" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can\/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup.  They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is.\n\nThe staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!  Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day.  I tried it, and it was AMAZING!\n\nMy experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well.  They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery.  Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.\n\nOne small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.\n\nYou can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.  Newspapers and reading materials are usually available to pick up, and there are board games in the back.  This is a great place for a rainy (or cold) day!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.\n\nWhen we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.\n\nMy favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!\n\nWhile I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!","useful":14,"funny":8,"cool":10}

If you're drinking on your own or with a single friend, that's fine and dandy- but it's near impossible to have a proper meeting with three or more people without forcing everyone to use inefficient mugs instead.

I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation, like everything else, that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn't get if it was made incorrectly. However, I still can't stand paying for it.\n\nHowever, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the \"Kokeicha\". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of \"gunpowder\" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the \"Kokeicha\" was very similar.\n\nThe tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own. Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they've never tried? I'll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time.\n\nEvery time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly, accommodating, and most of all informative. They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant, as I am, can get a little guidance. It's a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn't; how often do you drink gunpowder at home?","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But this place is a one-track pony... location, location, location. This is a family-owned bar\/restaurant and the owners know they have a captive audience. The beer is cold and the food is average, but the service is atrocious. On a recent beautiful Saturday afternoon, there were only two servers for the outside seating area.  There's no host, so we (4 adults and 1 kid) sat at a picnic table and proceeded to wait at least 10 minutes to no avail. We eventually went inside to order drinks and lunch. At no time during our visit did a server ever approach our table. I'd certainly be inclined to write off this awful experience to a bad day or poor staffing, but unfortunately this is more the rule rather than exception. One really weird thing is the Friday Fish Fry that features a special menu available ONLY inside, this isn't communicated very well;  so you'll grab a table outside, wait to order only to learn you can only order from the pizza\/sandwich menu.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Not my favorite, but it would do.\n\nMy second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came.\n\nToday I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich \"your way\" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread... \n\nTo say the least I really wanted to like this place, but I am not blow away by The Lunch Lounge. I have given them a 3 for effort. - Also to add I found out this last visit that they only have soup on Tuesday's","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one.

FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.\n\nI went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken.

The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working.

And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to. \n\nI have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite.

Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. \n\nI noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.\n\nAl Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. \n\nCarne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. \n\nGreat weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.","useful":66,"funny":42,"cool":67}

Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4\/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. \n\nService was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. \n\nI immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. \n\nWhile I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. \n\nMy friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world). \nSo after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner. \n\nNow I'll tell you why I will not go back again:\n\n1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean! \n\n2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok)\n\n3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon. \n\n4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)? \n\n5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!) \n\n6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any. \n\nOverall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience.\n\nThank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The only upgrade as of now is the restaurant itself. A few months ago it was very unattractive, almost cafeteria style, with hard seats like you would find in a food court. Kudos to them for getting a massive facelift. I wish I took pictures, but it looks lovely inside. They even have an electric fireplace (for some reason) in the tiny entrance. \n\nBut ambiance aside, the food itself did not get a similar makeover. I will never again order a masala dosa from this place. There was a mere SMEAR of potato bhaji, a few tablespoons at most, in my dosa. The chutneys were pretty bland and also in small amounts. The best thing was the sambar, spicy and warming. The dosa itself was very oily.\n\nMy dad had the Saravanaa Special Meal, which consisted of ten TINY dishes (curries, chutneys, curd and a gulab jamun), rice, two papad and two pooris. As is the apparent custom here, the poories were miniscule. They were baby poories. I mean, how much are they saving really by cutting the quantity of their menu items? \n\nAnd it's not like this place isn't hopping. We got there at 7pm for dinner and already a queue had formed. This was the trend for the rest of the night, and people even crowded outside and left when they were told it would be a half an hour wait.\n\nThe waitstaff were pleasant enough, although our server tried to take away my plate before I had finished. They also left the front door open for a while, telling us \"the air conditioning was not working\". It is necessary to note that it was 10 degrees tonight, not a balmy summer at all. \n\nThis restaurant is NOT good for groups. There are tables of 4, and they can put a few together if needed. But do not come in with a group of 15, like people did tonight, and assume you will get a table quickly. Check ahead of time if you can make reservations.\n\nMy mom had the best meal tonight, the Mini Tiffin. It came with uppama, mini idlis in sambar, a mini dosa (with probably the same amount of bhaji as my dosa!) and a sweet. The sweet sheera was delicious, with cashews and raisins. Sad I didn't go for that.\n\nPROS:\n- nice ambiance, comfortable booths\n- delicious, spicy sambar\n\nCONS: \n- oily dosas with virtually no filling\n- crowded early, stays that way through dinner\n- NOT good for groups (call ahead)\n- hasty servers who do not consider the weather\n- miniature food","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two. \nWe decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options. \nThe breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up.

The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well. \nOne of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be. \nWe asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total. \nFor two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip. \n\nI have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing. \n\nFinal verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffee\nDisliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience. \n\nWon't return.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I also found that the chutneys were rather inconveniently served to the left into three portions of the thali (steel square plate)\n-The sambar was okay; nothing special. For some odd reason unbeknownst to me, they had used 2 katoris (small steel bowls) which were stuck together to serve the sambar in \n-As for service, there was only one person serving when mom and I went here for lunch making service slow. \n\nSure it was decently priced; but the quality of food and service was worth WAY LESS than the $8 we cashed out for each dosa.

I equate it to going to your favorite wine tasting room and enjoying the various types of wine, except it's delicious beer (obviously). (e.g.; the Nines, you gotta try the Nines!). What it is not is a pub or a sports bar with super loud people, Budweiser and NFL whistles blowing from 50 TV screens...which is refreshing.  I feel a person just starting to develop their beer palette would feel right at home bellying up to the bar along side a person with a honed, mature beer palette. It's a place to try and sample what suits your beerbuds best.  With tons of amazing beer options that have awesome names you know have a story behind them, you can't go wrong.  My husband tried the coffee brown ale and he loved it! Oh, and it looks like they offer special \"reserve\" and yummy flavored type brews each week as well.

The amount of beer that comes with this deal is ridiculous - no joke!!\n\nIt's a nice looking establishment - very cool inside look...

Some of the beers were awesome, some okay, some were hard to drink.  A place like this is for a true beer conoausor because they do offer a fair amount of diverse beers, but I don't know enough about beer, how it's made, ingredients, etc. to be overly critical about beer quality per say.  I would have to say that the darker beers here seemed smoother than the light\/amber, and the beer made by\/using coffee were the best tasting in my personal opinion.\n\nWhen we first arrived the place was slammed - we could hardly find a place to sit down.  But oddly enough, the crowd died down very fast and by the time we finished our tasting around 7:30ish there was hardly anyone left in the place - it was dead for the most part, which seemed rather odd on a Friday evening.  The staff here was good - but no one was especially friendly or went out of there way service wise even when it got super slow....\n\nThe crowd seemed like college kids for the most part ...

It was a great crowd, and excellent beer.\nThere were two food trucks, one served poutine made Southwestern style, and instead of french fries, they sliced up tamales, and served the gravy and chilies on the top of that! By the way, that food truck was run by a guy named Craig.\nI had tried three of their beers the pale ale the IPA and the red and they were all excellent beers. I been to them before when they were cartel brewing and they were over in the old apartment building, and when they were in the coffee shop, but this venue is really nice and the the energy is palpable!\nI definitely will come back here, even when there are no political celebrities!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They really have the small-neighborhood-brewery thing down pat. I had the pleasure of chatting with one of the brewers, Andy, at the Strong Beer Festival while sampling their limited edition releases specifically for said event. The beers I tried there were AMAZING! One was the FYITM another was a special FYITM [i think a fruity version], and something else I can't recall. \n\nA week or so after, I host a Sunday Funday at The Shop for a large group of friends and luckily remembered to tell Andy about it at the Festival. He and his team were gracious enough to reserve space for our group. The weather didn't want to cooperate that Sunday but when I arrived it was fairly dead inside so I pushed together large floor tables in the corner with no problems. Andy did such a great job going over the beer list many times as people came in at varied times as well as keeping track of what we ordered and making sure the glasses did not run dry. I definitely recommend doing the flight - it's $8 for 4 samples which can be a mix from The Shop and\/or some from their guest beers. If I have to pick just 2 beers from The Shop to drink, #1 is the Galactic Porter Patrol nitro, #2 is Circus Bandit. \n\nI also recommend their food truck outside. While the guy\/waiter wasn't the kindest, the food was fabulous. I really loved the chicken tacos I had. Other positives I noted were the hummus dip and burger. I believe the food menu changes often [don't quote me]. Their ordering system is kind of confusing because you have to order beer & food separately but they come out on one check.

Recently it was thin mints, once it was jalapenos and sometimes they serve it with an accompanying bite (once it was a donut). Follow them on Instagram for Randall announcements as well as updates about entertainment, sometimes they host bands on the patio.\n\nThey do have a food truck, Fire and Foraged, which is basically a permanent on-site fixture. They are super creative with their food and have one of the best burgers I've ever had. They source a lot of their food locally-greens from Rhiba Farms and meat from Doublecheck Ranch-and as much as I hate not being able to rely on my favorites, I like that I'm hardly eve disappointed when I try something new.

I have been there over a dozen times now and easily over half of my drinks have been this way.  After a dozen visits I would say service is 60% good, 20% meh, and 20% bad.  I know it may seem minuscule to some but when you are buying premium product there should be pride in the company to give the customer what they are offering.

After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.\n\nActually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu. \n\nContrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came. \n\nBTW, make reservations.

IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned.  (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.)\n\nBut, ahh, the food.  This is probably the most creative food in Madison.  I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor.  There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls).  That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads.  In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing.\n\nCome with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I'd consider coming back just for that concoction alone.  We ordered the Tuna with Wasabi Flying Roe, Shrimp in Spicy Coconut Sauce, and the Pan Seared Scallop. (which was the favorite dish)  All of our food embodied unique flavors, and were demonstrations of  \"Asian fusion\" done right.  Our server was incredibly helpful with questions, and prompt without seeming as if she was trying to rush us out the door.  \nAlso prices were not that bad.  For 2 entrees, 1 roll, and drinks we exited the restaurant only about $60-ish poorer (including tip). I am definitely returning.

Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street. \n\nI was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal. \n\nI also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere.\n\nThe pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang.

Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights.\n\nEvery so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w\/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF.  Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server\/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it. Do me one better, and take the address WITH YOU when you go!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Next were the oyster\/quail egg shots. What a nice melding of flavors. This was followed by the corn\/lemongrass chowder- big disappointment, but I'll let it slide.\n\nOn to the main courses- started with the tuna\/mayo roll. This was a quite a big portion and really was a great sushi roll for those that like the bells and whistles. The hangar steak was tasty. The bleu cheese sauce was just perfect and made the steak that much better. Could have used just a tad more crust on the meat. Finally, we had the miso black cod. This is how fish should taste. It melted in your mouth, and was salty, but in a great way. \n\nTIP- go early or late (after 9) because they don't take reservations.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The service is always great, not just that they are prompt and attentive, but they know the menu and the drink menu and can make intelligent recommendations that I am usually pleased with.  Muramoto's creative rolls are SO delicious, they are all different tasting and the only comparison to their taste comes from good sushi places in Chicago.

Ok, with that out of the way....\n\nThe Space:  Just like the old Muramoto that was there, its a great space and feels like a 'big city' restaurant.  Dark, calm, cool, and the lighting is superb.  Great date place and it just feels sexy.\n\nThe Food:  I wanted to like it, I really did.  We ordered a wide variety of small plates and not ONE of them was good.  In fact, even they even managed to blow bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese.  Now thats not easy to screw up.  The plates ranged from merely ok to bad (octopus 'balls' were like fried croquettes with elastic bands in the middle).  \n\nThe Drinks:  Drinks were good.  Good pours, good selection and the Japanese booze was interesting.  \n\nThe Price:  Here's why Kushi Bar received an extra star.  The place is cheap for what it is, especially the drinks.\n\nSo all in all, go for drinks, ambiance and to impress a date.  Maybe even order a small plate or two but don't expect it to taste as gourmet as it sounds on the menu...","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The food and the service is great.\n\nSesame Crusted Big Eye Tuna with tahini sauce - I love it!  The sauce is so nutty and tasty and goes perfectly with the tuna and mixed greens.\n\nRock Crab Croquettes - it's their version of crab cakes but they deep fry the croquettes (4) and they arrive at your table piping hot.  They're delicious! - reminds me of my beloved dungeness crabs back home.   \n\nShrimp and Spicy Coconut Sauce with crushed peanuts - this is pretty good.  It's very similar to Thai food.\n\nHangar Steak with bean salad in bleu cheese & miso dressing - both times I've had it it's been a little tough and very chewy.  The bean salad (scattered around the steak on a long rectangular plate) drenched in the dressing is quite good.\n\nDESSERTS\nWe ordered the Sample Platter.  I'm glad we did because we were able to try some really interesting desserts.  This Platter is perfect for two people.\n\nYuzu (Japanese Citrus Fruit) Panna Cotta - a little more firm than normal panna cotta.  Didn't really taste the citrusy fruit.  But it was very good.  It kind of reminded me of a smoother version of cheesecake without the graham cracker crust.  It also had a drizzle of some berry compote.\n\nStrawberry Spring Roll w\/Honey ginger ice cream - I really liked the spring roll.  It was nice and hot and I think there was some sweetened sticky rice in it as well.  I'm a big fan of ginger but for some reason I didn't like the ice cream.\n\nHoney Black Sesame Creme Brulee - this was not my favorite but it was interesting.  The creme wasn't super creamy but had a little texture to it.  The color of the creme was a dark charcoal grey and tasted like smokey sesame.  It's a clever idea but not something I would try again.\n\nKabocha (Japanese pumpkin\/squash) Cheesecake - pumpkiny cheesecake with cinnamon or nutmeg with maple syrup lining the plate was my favorite.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The duck roll is outstanding as are the oyster shots, which are my favorite way to start dinner.\n\nCriticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it.  Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto.  This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve).\n\nService is just fine, ambiance is lovely.  Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt.  Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only.\n\n!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!! \nDowntown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location.  This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos.  On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm.  It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character.  Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down.  I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy.  But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good.  The new Hilldale location does not have the oyster shots, but they do have a delicious octopus salad which knocks me sockies off.  You might as well keep going.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good.

I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always.

I had to go to several different shops here in Arizona, since moving here 17 years ago, before I found the right one. I was very happy at that salon for almost 10 years. During those 10 years, I went to the same nail tech,for about 8 of the 10 years,he did\na great job, my nails lasted, and all was well! \nFor personal reasons I had to find a new salon.\nSo I went to a new place, it had high reviews and I got a new set and a gel pedicure! Everyone was nice and all looked okay, but they were so SLOW I was there 5 HOURS!!...I couldn't imagine ever going back there again, they were closed for over an hour, and I was still in there , the ONLY 1 in there!.....Not fun! \nSo I was stressed after that  , and knew I needed to  find a new place so now I am in the present time, and brings me to my review here today.  I took my time,and for 2 weeks,  I really did my homework. I researched, googled. read reviews, and finally decided on where I would go.  I chose Fancy Nails & Spa on Cave Creek Rd in Phoenix.  I didn't just make an appointment either. After I was done with all my research , I called about  4 of  the salons,  and went in person,  to see the salons, and speak to them, as well, as look at there selections of powders \/ colors. \nWhen I first called Fancy nails I spoke to the Owner David, he was very friendly. He offered for me to come in, and take a look, and told me they would take care of me, When I went to the shop, again he was friendly, I decided to make an appointment. For a new set and gel pedicure with Kim also eye brow wax.\nThey didn't have the chunky\/confetti powder that I am used to, but assured me they could order at a later time.My nails seemed okay, I was just glad to have them done, and have found a place, that I didn't  pay to close attention.As the holidays were fast approaching and I was very busy at that time. The gel pedicure was good looked nice. But I was a bit disapointed that my, toe nails were grown out so quickly, as I had said please make them extra short, I like them short. And even after she first cut them, I asked her to trim off more, glad I did, because they were still to long. I figured though it was my first time, so next time it will be better. \nI always got compliments  on my nails, especially the last 10 years. Well all of a sudden no one is complimenting me?! I thought that is really strange?!\nAfter a couple days I looked harder at my nails and I could see every little mark under the pink area?...and it looked weird....they never looked like that before. . I had them use medium pink, same thing I had always used, for 10 years . Then still no compliments, and each day they looked worse... it was like you could see all the drill marks straight through it, on my nail beds. I went back to my next appointment because now new years Eve was here, and I had a party to go to. This time the same thing happened with my nails, and my pedicure also. Now my daughter is asking me whats wrong with my nails?...And even my husband!. They don't  look nice anymore, my husband says. I wanted to cry. So I called the nail salon and spoke to David the owner, he said come in and he would take care of me himself.\nSo I did, and he said they needed to be removed, and cleaned up underneath, and a whole new set, and he would take care of me, and he did!...:) So now everything will be okay..right?\nwrong!!....\nIt helped,  But he had to drill my nail beds way way down a lot and it hurt real real bad to do that!...I had another pedicure by a different tech, once again I explained they were left to long  2 times, and I like them extra short,  make them very short. They said yes but, they did not.\nAfter 2 weeks ( and still no compliments) I was beside myself. So I made my appointment with David again, thinking Id try one more time. And when I got there I showed him all the drill marks on my nail beds. He then showed his daughter Hannah, and had her do my nails.She said would do back \/ fill and use \"her\" medium pink powder.  and it will cover all those marks. She then proceeded, without saying anything to literally rip off my finger nail, it hurt!. I pulled away, in pain, and said, no! you need to soak them off!..and she laughed!! and said I was sensitive and begin to rip again!.OMG!I couldnt believe it now there was BLOOD! and a huge throbbing pain she laughed again! I had tears It hurt for the whole time, she was not even sorry.When she was finally finished, They looked good, so I thought it might be Okay Well wrong again! 2 days later 1 nail was lifting!..I called Hannah.Can she please fix it? She said to busy!!..Maybe tomorrow!!?? I got really upset. Then she said ok come in.The owner David looked at it, he fixed it, and never said 1 word to me the whole time.I knew right then, I would not be returning. Next day another nail lifted and came off 1 by 1 til all are gone just shy of 12 days! OMG","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. Upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. They're tucked into the back of a complex on Rose Garden lane. Easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto Rose Garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. They're straight ahead of you there. \n\nIt's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when I got there, even though it was 1000 on a Saturday and they had only opened at 0900. Most people were actually there for pedis. Since I had an appointment I was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me.\n\nI do have to make a disclaimer- I hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. I did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in Vegas. The removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. And then I left, went shopping and literally in an HOUR had a giant chip. Of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. It was a very disappointing experience.\n\nBut getting mine done when I was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. So I decided to give it a shot again. \n\nAnd I'm glad I did. The removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. They had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (I wound up sticking with the color I wanted). The nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- I was in and out of the place in under an hour. I did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. The manicure I had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing.\n\nA week and these nails look as good as they did when I left the salon. I'm hard on my nails too- I pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. These still look great- no chips, wonderful shine. \n\nI think I might have found my newest addiction, and I'll definitely be back to get them done again! \n\nPlease do note that you can pay with DEBIT cards, but not credit. Also, like several reviewers noted below- bring CASH to tip.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I made an appointment the day before to get a gel pedicure, and a back fill. The reviews I read were really great. I'd been seeing the same nail tech for 6yrs and never had I complained. However she moved to California. They put me with a guy that didn't speak any English. I get my pedicure & nails done every 10 days. this young man took 90mins doing nothing! He put callus remover on my feet and then place them in the water Hmmm... I wonder where he got his nail tech license? He didn't remove the skin or calluses on my feet after putting callus remover on them. The shape of my toenails are not the same or even. Oh! And he forgot to massage my feet!! Then the owner came over and told me that they're really busy and couldn't do my nails and could I come back tomorrow and he would do a very good job on my nails for me!! \nI sat in that chair for 90 minutes frustrated with this moron that shouldn't be doing pedicures or any other kind of service. It was inadequate & way below average customer service. I watched the owner book appointments for ladies that just walked in with no appointment and ask them to come back in 20mins. Well I dealt with being stressed out by someone that was not properly doing their service then being told that they didn't have time to do my nails because they were too busy! I was charged $48 for something that I most certainly was not happy with. I told the owner to stick it up his A..\n\nHow can anyone be so rude I don't know? I wish there was a law or a requirement that in order to get your license to be a nail technician or to perform any kind of public service that every individual of any race needed to speak and understand The English language fluently before they were able to obtain their license!  \nI owned 2 hair salons in scottsdale and I don't ever recommend anyone going to fancy nails.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

A good thing to see with all the For Lease signs that have been cropping up lately.\n\nIf someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'll assume it is a greeting.  The friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else.  The Izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof.  Hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere.  Pretty much a tapas menu.\n\nAfter perusing the Sake menu, my wife and I settled on some Sapporo, mine in the bath-sized glass.  It wasn't that the Sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, I have limited experience with the Gekkeikan brand and I just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz, $15-30 sake that I may or may not like.  Maybe if I'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course I would have considered.\n\nAny way, food:\n\nIn absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry.  A little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti.  \n\nStarted with the Cucumber Addiction - sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil.  A great clean-tasting starter.  All orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much.\n\nThe Pork Rib Kakuni was really good.  3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour.  This was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs.\n\nThe Soy Bean Cream Crab Croquette is a mouthful.  Resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish.\n\nThe Tuna Carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish.  A little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort.\n\nThe Deep Fried Prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered.\n\nAs the evening progresses, more and more residents of Oakville filter in.  There is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space.  Conversations can be heard from basically every table.  The fake-chested table were amazed when Barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight.  A quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us.  Yaaaaay.\n\nThis is where service fell apart.  We had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert.  But with all the air-kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15-20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish.  Another 20 minutes later and the special of the night Cod we'd ordered arrived.  It was incredible and naturally buttery.  Any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously.\n\n\nFood for Thought:  if you come for the special catches of the day, come early.  4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7:30.  And the Blowtorch Mackerel?  It may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair.  Maybe its just me and my wacky palette.\n\nHopefully the \"trendiness\" wears off in the passing months.  The food is quite good and staff are helpful, sincere and very knowledgeable with the menu.  It is the clientelle that I could do without.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. \nWe ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. \nThe bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+\nThe salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B\nNext our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a \"back-of-the-throat\" heat which is perfect. So: \"A\" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! \nOverall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. \nI highly recommend coming here to try it out!

It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.\n\nMy wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.

I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Four of us sat down and ordered Cabernet. After a few minutes the waiter stopped by to have us remind him what beer we had ordered... We placed our order for food and he brought out a \"family style\" salad. Bad lettuce with a couple of poor cut onions slices. There was 4 of us and they served the table of 2 next to us the same salad. We asked for me and the snotty waiter slammed a bowl of just lettuce on the table a few minutes later. The funny part was they give you a gallon of dressing per person.. We decided that since it was the new place in town we would order a few apps so that we could try it out. But, using some caution we stuck to the basics -- Calamari and Fried Zucchini. Both were dripping grease and had zero flavor what so ever. Luckily I had lots of the Lemom Basil dressing left from my salad to give the Calamari the citrus it needed (never been served Calamari without a lemon to squeeze on top). The Zucchini was so soaked in grease none of us could eat it. They didn't clear off the table so at this point we are overloaded and there was no room for the bread that was brought to the table. Unfortunately we made room for it and it was the most stale bread I have ever had. Perhaps I was mistaken and they brough us croutons to go with our lettuce?\nI'll wrap up with the entrees. I had ordered the \"lightly breaded\" veal chop with arugala and they served a disgusting piece of veal with a heavy and burned breading. No seasoning was involved. I opted for the starch and I was hoping it would be a pasta but instead if was a bowl of red skinned potatoes that had been given a butter bath. I literally poured the butter from the top before I could even tell what they had served me. I could have used these potatoes to apply wallpaper the place--gross. My wife was served cold, undercooked pasta and shrimp without any seasoning at all. It was supposed to be \"diablo\" but zero spice . She had two bites and was done. One guest ordered a side of chicken to go with his pasta and 5 minutes after his pasta was brought out they showed up with a bowl of shredded chicken.. a literal WTF moment.. The last meal was salmon and just to wrap this up was an awful piece of fish with no flavor -- same butter drenched gross potatoes..\n\nWe were honest with the waiter when he asked how everything was but he was more interested in being condescending in between smoke breaks. The manager does not have the skill level to deal with this type of complaint. She tried to make it better by taking the chicken off of the bill and offering a free desert.. And after all of this our bill was almost $200.... what a joke. I hope the place that goes in here next is better -- shouldn't be long.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":1}

I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed.\n\nI'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey...

I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container...

Although they do have some drink specials and a pot of mussels for about 13-15 pounds. But once you start ordering appetizers or any of the other entrees, it can get pretty pricey pretty fast. I didn't think the mussels were anything out of the ordinary really -- and I was surprised to find cilantro all over mine (usually it's parsley when you order a shallot, butter, and white wine sauce). This wasn't on the menu so I had to try and pick the cilantro out. The one must-order here though I would say is the grilled scallops with butter appetizer. It's juicy, buttery, slightly sweet scallops on the shell -- and probably my favorite thing here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We booked in advance, but the place wasn't terribly busy in the end. The atmosphere is quite formal and a bit quiet, rather than bustling and busy. I went for the red curry mussels, as did my husband - my parents got the traditional with shallots and cream. The servers gave us the wrong mussel pots which took us a while to figure out, as all the sauce collected at the bottom and wasn't really coating the mussels, so we honestly couldn't tell whose was whose initially. We had to take some of the huge portion of mussels out and put them to the side, so we had space to use our spoons to coat the remaining mussels in sauce. Once we managed that though, the mussels were very tasty and fresh. The sauces were mild, but added a nice subtle flavour to the dish. Sides were decent but basic - slightly soggy fries, steamed seasonal vegetables, nothing terribly exciting. The price can't be beat though, at £14 for an enormous meal.\n\nNot the most memorable of meals, but an enjoyable one. I think a loosening up of the atmosphere would go a long way.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Everything from the sounds of laughter or someone racking up a new game, to the smell of the velvet table tops mixed with tap beer and mixed drinks. Even the dimly lit room seemed all to familiar. I loved it.\n\nArriving later in the evening, my friends and I were unsure how long we would be playing for and didn't know if we wanted to pay the hourly rate of $15\/Hr (even though it was very reasonable). Upon expressing this to our server he recommended that we use the $1\/game table. What a deal!! With the average game of pool taking about 5-15 minutes why wouldn't we explore this affordable option?!\n\nSeveral libations later we had played 8 games over 2.5 hours, saving ourselves $37 by playing the $1 tables. We didn't even have this kind of deal when we were students!\n\nPool is not something I regularly play, however if I am ever in Ajax again with a hankering to play, I'll be sure to head back to Petrina's with a pocket full of change.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This is the kind of service we received from Elite A\/V over and over, when they said they were going to do something they did it and always on time.

They replied back to me within minutes saying it would probably be around $99.00 which I found acceptable and scheduled an appointment for the next day.  They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV.   Since that was not a good option for me I declined and they were kind enough to not charge me for the service call.   I then thought about purchasing another home theater system but they suggested that I use the existing built in ceiling speakers.  I had originally not wanted to spend what I thought would be a lot of money to hook those up but after further discussions with Dylan I agreed this was the best route.   He was able to provide a receiver and sub-woofer for me or I could have went out and purchased my own.  I verified based on his quote and the cost was no more than what I would have paid at Best Buy.   We rescheduled for the next day for the install and again they were right on time.  Kevin and his partner came out and completed the installation in about 2  1\/2 hours talking us through the whole process.  They had to cut a small hole in the back of the entertainment center so they could attach the wires which I was at first not crazy about but it was very small and behind a closed door so it was a non-issue.

I called Elite A\/V after reading the yelp reviews.  I called because the picture on my smart TV would go black if I even moved the receiver a fraction of an inch. Also I couldn't get Netflix audio to play through my surround sound. I called the office around noon today and the technician, Dylan, was at my door at 4:00 pm. Dylan was as professional, courteous and knowledgeable as it gets. Within 10 minutes Dylan had run a new HDMI cable inside the wall, switched some connections and presto now Netflix audio was playing through my surround sound! All that was perfect but it got even better. I asked Dylan about television options outside of the cable companies. We talked about Roku for streaming various shows and channels. Dylan was kind enough to offer to come back another day and set me up with Roku at no extra charge (outside of the cost for the Roku itself) as he had only been there about 20 minutes out of the hour I was being charged. Well it turned out that Dylan had a new Roku in his truck and 30 minutes later Dylan had helped us set up an account and explained in detail how it worked. Dylan even loaded some free channels for us. I'm an older guy, in fact I think I have some socks older than Dylan but he was extremely patient and courteous in explaining everything. Now I can really reduce or even eliminate my Direct TV bill. Incredible! \nPlease use Elite A\/V for any home theater needs you may have.\nI can't recommend them any higher and can't thank Dylan enough for his assistance.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

A week later I followed up with them to see if they had come up with an estimate and was informed that they didn't have my contact information. When I finally did get the estimate it left off things we discussed and seemed a bit high, so I replied asking for clarification. Again a week went by with no reply until Jeremy contacted me to ask if I received their estimate, when I told him I had but had some questions and that I had replied to their original email asking for clarification. As we started to go over my questions I was informed that Chris was now out of town and Jeremy would have him contact me when he got back. Again a week went by with no contact until a third person called to follow up and see if I ever got the quote? I told the third person that I had and discussed it with Jeremy the prior week and I was still waiting to hear back from Chris, I was told he would follow up. As it turns out Chris did call a few minutes later but he didn't use my home number so his call went to voicemail. Never did talk with Chris but yet a fourth person called after another couple of days to follow up on the original quote. As I stated at the beginning they do appear very capable of doing a first rate job, but I will never know as their follow up to questions was basically nonexistent as their only real follow up was to ask for the job not answer any of my question and when we are looking at a $6,000 camera install, they could take a few minutes to answer questions. Reading all their reviews it does appear that I'm in the minority but I get the impression they really have very little internal communication or perhaps my job was just over their head, I'll really never know.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Professional, on time and really good to work with!  They made the entire process fun.  First, you can immediately tell that these guys know what they are doing - they've \"been there and done that.\"  They are personable, professional and make you feel at ease - whether you buy gear from them or have your own, you can be assured that they will treat you the same and give you top notch advice on both integration and installation.  Although it's always best to get the gear from them and what they recommend, if you already have your own, they'll still work with you - which is different than MOST companies who will refuse your work altogether.  This is why Elite is so great.  My project was by far NOT the biggest because I'm a geek and like to do a lot myself, but they didn't shy away.  They did the work with a fervor and completed it with just as much energy and enthusiasm as if it was an entire house automation system with $250k worth of gear.  If you choose another company to do your work, you are making a mistake.  They did ZERO damage, nothing was amiss, the place was treated with respect and they were laughing and joking with me the entire time making me feel comfortable.  They quoted me to install my projector and screen, but even spent time terminating a few sub cables I had and did a quick calibration on the projector just to ensure the screen was \"OK.\"  Who does that?  In Las Vegas, where everyone is out for the money, this is a company that is more interested in customer satisfaction and value.  I would work with them again in a heart beat.  Again, if you choose another company for your work - it's your mistake, don't say I didn't warn you!\n\nPS: When they make a recommendation, believe me - take it.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So a few days ago, I received a call from a Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, asking me if I was interested in selling my 2013 Prius c back to them, and that they can compensate me, and give me some kind of offer on a new car.\n\nI've never been asked for a buy back, so I thought what's the harm, I thought I go and see what they were going to offer me.  At first nothing was laid out clearly, but we slowly got to see what the numbers were, because all I wanted to see was the numbers, that's all I wanted.  Lisa stepped out and I talked to the manager (indian) directly,  we talked for a while,  still couldn't get a confirmation on what the set monthly payment will be, he wanted me to say yes before giving me the final offer, then he started to get very impatient with me, I felt very uncomfortable\/pressured,  we ended the talk and that was that.\n\nBefore going home, I went over to the service department to chat with an advisor, I had some thing I wanted to ask him, then Lisa came back and started giving me better offers, now that I have the numbers, I see what I was actually into,  but I decided the better option of me was to keep the car that I have, and continue driving it.   Throughout the whole process, Lisa stayed really patient and professional, but I kept saying no and they kept giving me better offers.\n\nAt the end, I decided not to trade in for a new car, but Lisa still gave me a warm good bye, but another manager (caucasian) still trying to strike a deal, asking what would be a number I'm happy with, said he can tried to see if he can offer me a 90 days free of payment, I wasn't bluffing, I really was there to see what the offer was and decided I am better off with not trading my car, at the end he question me what I came the first place, which I did not appreciate.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend anyone looking for a toyota to talk to Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, but I would be very wary of the managers there, and do your research before going.  The indian manager told me toyota will still continue to offer the the prius c and prius v (wagon) for another two years, which I am not sure if he is just saying that to make a sale, or if it's confirmed.\n\nFrom my understanding, the prius c\/v will most likely not get replaced, and only the standard prius, and maybe later a plug in prius will be added to the line up.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I walked out happier than when i walked in and it was purely based on service received; not the cut price package of Pirate cookies that made it into my basket.\n\nThe store itself is medium sized but seems to pack pretty much everything in.

Nooooo! \n\nIn the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items. \n\nGranted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else. \n\nG Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?). \n\nThe fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers.  \n\nThe buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served. \n\nThe sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be). \n\nIt isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a \"Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant\" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname. \n\nThe service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread. \n\nSort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks. \n\nI'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients).","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions. \n\nThe place is defiantly a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also.\n\nThe employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would defiantly call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while.\n\nThe chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes.

Well, I love their food. Their service is very hit or miss.\n\nThough HSW is a bbq joint, I don't think it's necessarily their strongest point. The bbq sauce is really fantastic. The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ. \n\nWhere HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods.\n\nFor drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer\n\nThough I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now.\n\nIf I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed.\n\nIf you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW. Also, the Carnegie location is right down the road from the Cleveland Clinic main campus. So, if you have an appointment with your cardiologist or nutritionist or whatever, you may as well stop by for some lunchtime fried perch and peach cobbler after your appointment.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Thank you.\n\nWell, let me tell you.  I love he food here!  However, I had a costly-to-owner and manager, and a terrible experience today (well, the 12th a Wednesday), and they need to know if they want to keep customers!!!  Who knows how many people just walk out because of the rude and slow staff - I'm sure they do it all the time and just don't tell the boss.  Here is what I am trying to communicate, and I can find no other way.  Website non-existent.\n \nMy would-be communique:\nYou lost 3 customers in a row today, August 12, at about 4:30, including the 2 ahead of me and then me.  I would have spent around $20.  The two were mother and son, and who knows what a growing boy eats?!  \nThe 2 in front of me (no one else in line or the restaurant) waited and waited even to be acknowledged let alone waited on.  There were 3 employees - a man and 2 women -who saw clearly we were there.  The customers and I chatted pleasantly for a good 5 minutes.  They got tired of waiting - for anything.  They left.  I was now the only customer.  One would think that their seeing 2 walkouts would have prompted them to action!  \nThe 3 of them stood directly in front of me at the register!  They did everything to pretend I wasn't there.  Could they not have said \"we'll be right with you\"?  Totally ignored me and instead counted tickets and chit-chatted about.  There was plenty of food, so they were in no crunch.  I'd have spent $20 - LOSS.  Mother and son, who knows? - LOSS.  I go to your place because it's usually great and I am a frequent Clinic visitor.\nFrankly, I would fire all three of these employees if I were you.  You've got a great business, but who knows how many customers walk out.  RUDE EMPLOYEES might be chasing away more than you know.  \nSusan Bednar","useful":14,"funny":1,"cool":0}

A year ago I would recommend anyone visiting Cleveland to come here.  NOT AFTER TODAY!!  I used to LOVE going here!  The Polish boy was one my personal favorites.  Today, I was on my way home and just happened to come by Hot Sauce Williams so I pulled in.  I knew I would have to wait at the drive thru but ...WOW!  15 minutes??  I should have just parked my car and went in.  Drive Thru is a BAD IDEA at this establishment.  I pulled up to the speaker and a piece of cardboard was over the speaker and written in marker saying \"STOP! Order here!\" I ordered and I will come to find out that the prices on their outside menu are WRONG and MORE EXPENSIVE than listed! (I didn't know this but I will explain later). On top of that, it looks like the window covering the menu and prices has not been cleaned since 2012. I ordered the Polish Boy combo and small size fried okra.  I had a couple in front of me and waited approximately 5 minutes before I arrived at the window ( I made a mental note changing radio stations because when I arrived at the window it took longer than the entire song of Baltimora 'Tarzan Boy' as I kept changing stations to pass times and ended back on the 80's channel to hear the end of that song and start a new one).  Do not think of this place as a typical 'fast food' drive thru.  You order and you will WAIT but they don't tell you that which can be a good thing.  This can give you the impression that the food is fresh but to tell you the truth, it didn't seem like it was 'fresh' in least bit.  In fact, it appeared that they took care of of whoever was inside BEFORE the drive thru customers because I actually watched 3 polish boys being made while I waited for my single polish boy because I guess the people inside took priority and they had only ONE person making food with 3 other people handling money and passing out beverages.  While watching someone else's food being prepared another employee came to the window and gave me my ridiculous total of $11.98!!  I gave her my money and at first I just simply thought the tax was high so I asked why my total was $11.98?  Apparently the prices listed on their dusty and dirty outside menu board are WRONG!  The RUDE employee didn't tell me anything.  She just \"handed\" me a receipt.  Instead of the okra being $2.75 it was $3.99!  I told the lady this and she just said, \"It is?  I will have to change that.\"  She walked away and I NEVER saw her again. Well, what about you OVERCHARGING??  I was already upset waiting for food so I turned my car off to save gas until I arrived at the window. I was overcharged and the lady avoiding me now, had another employee hand me my beverage. Coke in a can. As I was saying my food was over charged, she closed the window!! WHAT!! This is how you deal with customers with issues!?!? You AVOID them! \n     Finally I received my food.  They had ANOTHER employee hand me the food and this worker was a male.  I was actually able to talk with him and say that I was overcharged. He was not helpful or even courteous in ANY way! He said, \"I can't help you, I don't work with the menu.\" I kept telling him, this was WRONG, you can't overcharge customers and you can't treat people like this! Again, like a robot, \"I can't help you with that.\"  I heard enough. \"If you can't fix this or help and NONE of you are willing to help without me making a scene then I'm DONE with ALL of you!\" He replied again, \"I can't help you\" and shut the window then walked away while all the other employees avoided the window. \n     I'M NEVER RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! What happened?? The employees don't care! A year ago this was a decent place! They even have photos of Robin Williams (I miss him so much!) visiting there with his family.  What happened? I don't know and I WISH I could give this place more stars but this whole experience was enough for me to give them the LOWEST rating. I had a few good times here in the past with some memorable moments but it will ALWAYS be overlooked by this horrible treatment! THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT AND ATTITUDE! Even the food changed in my opinion. My Polish Boy was a regular sized hot dog with fries and coleslaw slapped on top of it and my fried okra was soggy.  Worst of the all, the sauce was different this time too. It was watered down and tasted old if that's possible. I WILL NOT RETURN.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I went into the Coach store and they offer many bags not found anywhere else so it was a nice store. It's nice to grab an ice cream cone and walk around to people watch and window shop, then return to reality! Fashion mall was great alternative with things I can actually afford :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So, gents, let me explain why this is actually happening and to have a successful \/ fun \/ enjoyable afternoon with your lady in Las Vegas. \n\nStep 1: Regardless of where you're staying, suggest to them \"Today I think we should stop by one of the casino bars after breakfast and have some champagne. Then we'll game for a half hour or so after which we'll walk through the Palazzo and do some shopping\" - at which point she'll agree because you said the magic word: SHOPPING!\n\nStep 2: Enact the plan - head down to the casino bar and ply her with mimosas or bellinis or whatever...so long as it has champagne in it, you're golden. Have a couple yourself. Gamble. Casually announce that you're off to do some shopping.\n\nStep 3: Amble your way along to the Palazzo - if you come in through the front then walk through the casino, stop at a gelato shop, etc. Make it enjoyable. \n\nStep 4: Upon arriving at the Palazzo your jaw will drop (yes, even you, lowly non shopping gents) at the staggering displays therein. And so will your lovely lady's jaw drop. Stop at a couple stores and then announce that you need a refill. \n\nStep 5: Stop at the Double Helix Wine Bar and collect glasses of wine for your and your date \/ significant other.\n\nStep 6: Tag along while they shop. You're now pleasantly buzzed and you'll find you don't hate it. \n\nStep 7: While shopping you'll invariably find something that (a) costs a little less than what she was expecting and (b) costs a bit more than what you were expecting. BUY IT. \n\nStep 8: The remainder of your trip to Vegas will be the best time of your life and you can pretty much do anything.\n\nThere you have it guys...I just showed you how to have THE BEST trip to Vegas with your lady \/ significant other. \n\nPS: You can use this unlimited times and your gal will ALWAYS want to go back to Vegas then.","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":1}

Wir sind schon öfter an dieser Pizzeria vorbeigegangen und ich habe über den Namen etwas die Nase gerümpft - Regenbogen, das klingt so nach schlechter 80er Jahre Taverne.\n\nDrinnen ist es dann im ersten Eindruck auch ein bisschen, wie bei einer kleinen Zeitreise - allerdings nicht in die 80er, sondern in die 90er, in die mich gerade die Lampen und die Einrichtung zurückversetzten. Was ich aber sehr charmant fand, waren die Theaterfotografien an den Wänden.\n\nBeim Service war ich am Anfang etwas verunsichert, weil der gute Herr wirklich finster gucken konnte, aber das verbesserte sich im Laufe des Abends merklich und jeder, der an unseren Tisch kam war immer höflich und professionell. Außerdem waren Getränke und Speisen immer unverzüglich an unserem Tisch, auch als es später am Abend sehr voll wurde - so lob ich mir das.\n\nDas Essen war dann ein wahres Gedicht, angefangen beim Brotkorb mit frisch gebackenen Pizzabrötchen bis hin zur Nachspeise, was wieder zeigt, dass man sich nicht von Äußerlichkeiten abschrecken lassen darf. \nAuf der gemischten Vorspeisenplatte fanden wir ein Gedicht an italienischer Salami und Schinken sowie exzellentem Käse. Mein Bruschetta war ein frisch gebackener halber Pizzafladen mit frischen Tomatenstückchen, die ordentlich mit Knoblauch garniert waren - sehr lecker!\nDie Hauptgerichte haben uns dann absolut überzeugt: Ich hatte frische Nudeln von der Tageskarte mit Steinpilzen. Die Nudeln waren einen winzigen Tacken zu al dente für meinen Geschmack, aber sie zogen noch etwas nach. Die Steinpilze in der Soße mit frischen Kräutern waren hervorragend. \nAber das absolute Highlight war die Pizza: wie in Italien. Hauchdünner, geschmacklich hervorragender, knuspriger, aber nicht trockener Teig mit leckerem Mozzarella, der ordentlich Fäden zieht und frischem Belag, der die anderen Zutaten nicht erstickt. Ich bin sonst von Pizza nicht so leicht zu beeindrucken, aber diese war einfach ein Gedicht.\nDer Tiramisu zum Nachtisch musste dann noch sein, obwohl wir eigentlich schon satt waren. Er hat den hervorragenden Eindruck des Essens noch unterstrichen.\n\nAuch der Wein war hervorragend und mit 4,50 Euro für 1\/4 Liter auch nicht besonders teuer. Insgesamt war das Preis-Leistung-Verhältnis (9 Euro für die Pizza, 10,50 Euro für die Nudeln) für die Qualität absolut angebracht.\n\nEiner meiner Lieblingsitaliener in Stuttgart, wenn es mal eher gemütlich als schick sein soll.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Staff are still growing into their roles, but friendly. Good for dressy dates, business meetings, and hopefully drinks on the patio when the weather is warmer! \n\nIt's a shame that this shiny new part of Cleveland doesn't get the traffic it deserves after the boom that was Summer 2016. Getting here is about a 10 min walk from the RTA station, but at night, when there's hardly anyone around, and your phone light is shining brighter than the streetlights... The empty buildings can be pretty eerie. Buuut, I guess I can't complain about having my pick of the reservation times during Downtown Restaurant Week. \n\nThe Burnham can be entered directly from the side of the Hilton building, and my friend and I were pretty impressed by the upscale nautical wall deco. Everything still looked as though the plastic wrap had just been taken off. We were shown in short order to our table, a half-booth ordeal. Normally I'm all about the booth tables, but our booties sank a little too deep into the plush seat and made the table an awkward height to lean your arms on. Which, if you have just above can't-take-you-ANYWHERE etiquette like me, you tend to do quite often. Anyways. We were brought some complimentary bread and olive oil while looking through our menus, but the server nearly dropped the bread on the table instead of our plates, and the bread was quite plainly not fresh. A rough start. \n\nOur hearts and stomachs dropped a little when we saw our first appetizer (not part of the Prix Fixe menu), five tiny Garlic & Onion Beignets. This was definitely not Southern hospitality. They were pretty good, but gone too soon, including the pickle garnish. Each of us then chose different salads for the first course and were pleasantly surprised by the unique ingredients. No plain Caesar from the grab bag - mine had a crunchy mix of greens, pickles, sunchoke, and a light dressing. Main course involved a Swordfish Schnitzel for me, and a Sous Vide Fried Chicken for her. You heard right. Schnitzel and sous vide, chicken and swordfish? Did they draw these combos out of a hat? Maybe, but they work surprisingly well together - both meats were tender, the accompanying sides (radish + mashed potatoes for me) appropriately balancing. I could probably have done with less salt overall, but know that you'll be leaving full after an entree. The desserts were cute trays of Petit Fours, including cake pops and macarons. Nothing mind-boggling, but easy to pack up and eat on the go. \n\nLike others have said, service was fairly slow. It took a while for our dishes to come and for water to be refilled even though we were one of probably five tables that evening. The staff is definitely rough around the edges compared to the establishment (I mean, have you SEEN the bathrooms? Go, just go outside across the hallway, and enjoy the gilded glory.). It's not a place you should expect to grab a quick bite - although I think I spotted a kid eating chicken tenders a few tables over. But food-wise, we felt we got what we paid $30 (+ an appetizer) for. The menu, the staff, the booty-sucking seats, it all feels a little experimental, but I think we got some positive results out of the evening.","useful":4,"funny":4,"cool":3}

Chose this restaurant because our party had been to most restaurants in Cleveland and the Burnham had only been open 16 days when we ate there.  \n\nOurs was a party of four and had no time constraints so we decided to do a couple courses of splitting the small plates.  After our incredible waiter Joseph walked us through some of his favorite things and some of the background for some of the food, we chose our first course as Octopus salad, soft shell crab special, chilaquiles, shrimp and grits, and fried rice.  All of these dishes were as advertised and devoured by our party.  The octopus salad was some of the most tender, tasty octopus we have had anywhere in the country let alone Cleveland.  The chilaquiles were like a mexican pancake with pulled pork and rock shrimp baked in.  The shrimp and grits were great.\n\nOur second course we chose soul bowl (mac and cheese with pork belly and collard greens), boudin and mash (blood sausage and mashed potatoes), confit wings, and the five cheese pizza.  While I don't like collard greens, the mac and cheese and huge pieces of pork belly was good.  The blood sausage and mashed potatoes were a british\/irish delicacy and delight.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were great.  The confit wings were a bit salty but they literally fell off the bone and were served with a green sauce that I can't quite figure out what it was.  The pizza was great topped with tomato and basil and quite flavorful.\n\nOur party had a couple bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and some of their cocktails (Sacre Bleu and French 75).  The cocktails were all made from scratch and delicious.\n\nThe staff at this restaurant were incredible with multiple people from servers, hosts, back kitchen staff, and managers all making their way to our table to wish one a Happy Birthday and welcome us to the restaurant.

Nothing crazy but just a nice simple home cooked meal while traveling -- something we all crave. \n\nThe Sous Vide chicken was well prepared, maybe just a touch over done, and the creamy mash and broccolini were nice accompaniments. While the broccolini was a tad under-salted, the mashed potatoes were a bit over-salted so I ate them together and it was perfect. I can handle that.

His push for the featured Mitchell's Banana Pudding ice cream was a win, especially with his flexibility in swapping out the vanilla ice cream on the chocolate angel food cake dessert dish. Yum!\n\nAll in all, I think the restaurant offers good value, a fun vibe, and it's awesome that you can go for pre- or post-dinner drinks at the 32 Bar (rooftop)!\n\nFinal thing: I loved their dining chairs. Upholstered and so comfortable. It may sound silly but chairs make a huge difference! I felt relaxed the whole time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was told by the gentleman who answered the phone that he needed manager approval for that many people, and put me on hold. I waited a few minutes, and when he returned he informed me that he couldn't find a manager but would take down my information and someone would call me back. I waited 24 hours and didn't hear from anyone, so I called back. I explained that I had called the day before and needed to speak to a manager, and was placed on hold for ELEVEN MINUTES before I finally hung up. I called back for a third time and immediately asked to speak to a manager, by which the person responded rudely \"well can I take a message, we are a little busy right now.\" I said \"no, you may not take a message, I need to speak with a manager immediately.\" I was placed on hold AGAIN, this time for more than five minutes. I FINALLY got a manager, Franc, on the phone who didn't even bother apologizing for my troubles. \n\nOn Wednesday I get a call from the restaurant (two days after my first attempt to make a reservation) telling me they couldn't accommodate my party.

We were seated next to the bar so had the chance to interact with their bartender who made the experience even better. Super friendly guy, very knowledgeable mixologist--everything he made was great.

We ordered several small plates to start with: calamari, pierogis, and octopus. Everything was delicious and the preparations were creative and unlike what we've had at other restaurants. We especially loved the sauce on the pierogis and the octopus was so good we wound up getting another order. For dinner, we tried Oxtail, Burnham Burger, and Shrimp & Grits.

I was out with my son and we came across this place. It looks like a new place trying to look old. So, the name is perfect. The layout reminded me a lot like sonic and the drive ins back when I was really young. The interior is really nice and I thought they did a great job of decorating.\n\nI ordered the Banzai dog and my son ordered the White hot dog. We also decided to get a large order of fries to split and my son got a root beer. We went there about a week ago and my son is still talking about how magnificent the root beer was. He also loved the hot dog, but said it might have been a little salty. I thought that the banzai dog was also fantastic. The banzai sauce is really what makes it. You could put that on just about anything and make it taste good. Plus, its covered with bacon.. \n\nWhenever I order fries and I see that they are fresh cut fries, my brain automatically thinks Malt Vinegar. I grabbed one of the containers and took it back to our seat. We were seated along the windows so when the light hit the container, something caught my eye. It looked like there were 2-3 ants floating in the bottom of the container. I took the container back to the counter and gave it to the person there and showed them, told them I thought they were ants. Then I noticed all of the vinegar containers had this substance in them. I went back to my seat and a few minutes later the manager shows up with a pan, in which she had poured out the vinegar in to show me they were not ants. She explained that it was a fatty spongy substance that collects in vinegar containers. I told her that I have several different vinegar containers at home, some that I have had for 2+ years and I have never seen this substance. I She said it is common and found it on the internet. So of course I asked the obvious question, \"How long has that vinegar been in those containers that it would have this fatty spongy substance?\" She told me that they empty them every week and refill them. Now, I know I look like I just fell off the yam wagon, but I find it hard to believe that your vinegar forms that in a week and mine hasn't in over 2 years. My ten-year-old was able to ascertain that you were full of crap so needless to say, your excuse needs work. I wasn't asking for a free meal, just say \"Geeze, that's gross.. let me get you a new one.\" \n\nRegardless of the vinegar incident and the manager clearly trying to cover her ass, I thought the place was great. I will probably return again if I am in the area, but I think I will skip the fries and vinegar.","useful":3,"funny":4,"cool":3}

As an ovo-lacto vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products), I am never sure if somewhere that specializes in hot dogs will have any options for me, but RETRO Dog has not one but three vegetarian entrees--a veggie dog, a veggie Italian sausage, and a black bean burger. They also offer veggie chili, veggie coney sauce, and veggie cheese fries.\n\nI had a veggie dog with veggie coney sauce and cole slaw and a side of onion rings. The dog had a pleasant texture and flavor and the toppings were scrumptious. I have tried quite a few veggie dogs in my day and this was definitely one of the best. The onion rings were unlike any other rings I have tried. The batter had an interesting flavor and was not crumbly like many other rings, but it was crisp and delicious. I also enjoyed the zesty sauce that accompanied the rings.\n\nI chose the locally-brewed root beer for my beverage and I was not disappointed. The flavor was mellow and not overly sweet and it was served in a fancy chilled mug. \n\nMy dining companions ordered a veggie Italian sausage, a RETRO Dog, a Red Hot, and a couple other meat dogs and everyone was satisfied. We also happened to go on a buy one, get one free hot dog day, which was a pleasant surprise for the pocket book. \n\nWe chose to eat inside, rather than utilizing the Swenson's-style carports. They looked fine, if that's your thing. The atmosphere inside is a fun mix of retro kitsch and contemporary.

Kind of separate from anything else, you will see a large take out with parking out front where you can have the food brought out to your car or go in to the cool dining area.

The menu consists of hot dogs, sandwiches, sides and plenty of ice cream based desserts.  \n\nI have had the veggie retro dog, the fries, onion rings and a couple of milk shakes, overall the food is good, not great.  The veggie retro dog is a pretty nice veggie hot dog with veggie coney sauce, mustard and onions on a wheat bun.  The mild hot dog has a nice snap but it could have used more of the toppings, especially the coney sauce, which is a mild veggie chili.  The french fries are fresh cut, but were not terribly crisp.  The onion rings missed the mark with the fried batter overpowering the flavor of the onions and they seemed a bit overcooked.\n\nThe 2 milkshakes I tried were the best items I had at Retrodog; prepared fresh with soft serve ice cream.  The flavor selection is extensive and they have some unique flavors for you to try.  The chocolate banana was a nice balance of the banana milk shake with hot fudge; the salted caramel was a nice balance of sweet with a hint of salt.

This was going to be a 3-star review until after I finished eating, turned on my lights, waited 15 minutes, then had to CALL them to come out and take my money. The young man really was giving good curb service until the end. He was very apologetic, but come on, he saw my lights on as did another young man. They took care of 3 other cars and ignored me.

You know, just for a snack.\n\nFor some reason, I was feeling adventurous that day.  I went against my instincts and, at the recommendation of Liana E, I went with the veggie dog.  I got mine topped simply with just the special mayo mustard.  I also went, of course, with a cup of the locally brewed root beer.  I debated the growler when I saw them on the counter, but it seemed a bit pricey (I think it was $15 for the growler full of root beer).\n\nI took my cup and dog to go, but really just sat outside at one of the tables since it was such a nice day.  I unwrapped my dog and was surprised at it's size - bigger than I expected.  This was going to be more than a snack.  I took a bite.  And instantly my brain thought, \"This doesn't taste like a hot dog.\"  Then I remembered, duh, I ordered the veggie dog.  The taste was not unpleasant to my meat-loving sensibilities.  And the special mayo mustard, which I think was just mayo mixed with dijon mustard, had a nice flavor to it.  Though I'm not sure it was the best condiment for the veggie dog.  The root beer was aces.  I still regret not splurging on that growler.\n\nI've vowed to return to the area and I'd like Retro Dog to be part of it.  If I enjoyed the veggie dog so much, I can only imagine how much I'd like the meat hot dogs.  I also saw some amazing looking onion rings I'd like to give a try as well as some tasty looking desserts.  Seems like my kind of place.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":2}

The best 2 things about the one on the strip, they are open 24 hours and they sell beer.  What can make this place better? Well, it is also attached to a casino! The place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate.  If you haven't tried White Castle, now is your time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They sell their signature miniature \"slider\" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in. \n\nThe restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer. \n\nA large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others. \n\nLast, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect. \n\nMy experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again. \n\nIf you are nearby in the area, take a look!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

(Service-wise). The food is relatively standard-ware. I came and waited in line with 3 of my friends on an afternoon, and waited about 20 minutes in line to place my order. I understand that places get busy, so it was acceptable.\n\nHowever, after about 30 minutes of waiting for our orders, my friends all got their orders, but I still had not yet received mine. I inquired several times about my order, and where it was in the queue. My friends finished eating, and we kept waiting around.\n\nEach time I asked, the person handing out the food would promptly dismiss me, and even the manager bluntly and rudely told me they serve hundreds of burgers a day, and it would come out soon enough. \n\nAlso note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order.\n\nNow, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order.\n\nInstead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars.\n\nIf they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues. Instead, this Whitecastle decides to run as if the customer is always wrong, and will stonewall and lie to you about your order.\n\nOnce a mistake is also made, they will make a measly effort to fix their problems.\n\nI strongly recommend you go elsewhere for a burger fix in Vegas.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle!  \n    So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long.  \n     As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'.\n     There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter.\n    I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside. \n    Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed.\n    Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location.  The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor.  They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra.  No frills needed, or really requested for that matter.  The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for.\n\nThis location is 24\/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy.  I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality.\n\nIn a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me.

Seriously.  What in the world did you expect?  \n\nAs far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some.  I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time.  I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger.  \n\nThe burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart.  Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said \"we're soldiers!\".  I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name.  My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing.  I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip.  A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations.  I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location.  Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers.  They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us.  I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries.  Large sodas ($2.99) were separate.  The bill came out to $38.88.  I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame.  For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at.  \n\nAlso, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA.  That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items.  They could've easily included the soda.  \n\nI won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice).","useful":21,"funny":6,"cool":4}

We even offer to pay for them.\n\nThe patience paid off and we went home with 14 sliders and fries for free!\n\nThe customer service was amazing.

I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier?\n\nAs for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh.\n\nAbout the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that? Also, there were TWO security guards working this location, which only amplified the negative vibes in this place. And our table was damaged enough that it made eating uncomfortable - such a shame at such a new location.\n\nNot recommended.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My wife in vertically challenged, and did not want to have to push her way through a crowd of wined up aficionados, to get a glimpse of the image as it was being talked about.\n\nWe walked away with a bitter taste in our mouths from the bad wine and the old style vegas treatment of people like cattle.\n\nWallace Eastman","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Yet after walking up and down the Strip for a couple hours and repeatedly reminding myself of why I'm not a Las Vegas type of guy, this Gallery was a welcome and peaceful respite. With the audio guide in my ear, I enjoyed the overwrought explanations and wandered back and forth as I actually tried to learn something. It was an enjoyable time, and I was actually sorry that I had to go back and brave the happy hordes again.","useful":7,"funny":5,"cool":5}

This city keeps on pleasantly surprising me. \n\nThe Monet exhibition is on view through January 6, 2013. This exhibition showcased 20 works by Monet and eight other works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Camille Pissarro, and Eugene Louis Boudin.\n\nFebruary 2013 onwards we can look forward to a Warhol series. \n\nThe gallery itself is pretty compact, the audio aids provided are quite easy to use and the gallery doesn't seem to get too crowded to allow enjoyment of these exquisite works. Although I have to mention that the audio provided quite a lot of useless information rather than descriptions of the art work and the artists. \n\nStrangely enough, in addition to the gorgeous art, I was drawn to the walls of the studio that were painted a stunning purple!\n\nThe cost of a ticket here is around $16 for adults ($13 for locals) and children under 12 are free. Pretty reasonable for a priceless experience. \n\nIt's nice to partake in these creative gems without taking an international flight. If only this were a little bit bigger....think the Art Institute of Chicago maybe? We did Smith Center...now for a large museum (that's not mob related) Vegas!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

But since it's not, I have to go with the value in my eyes, which was pretty low. \n\nI came here for the company anyways!  LOL","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I came to Vegas for the 4th of July weekend and noticed that they just recently opened a Picasso exhibit titled Creatures and Creativity. I was extremely intrigued and wanted to visit. However, it was far too crowded. I came back to Vegas about a month later when it was far less crowded and came by the gallery. \n\nI like to think of myself as a modern art aficionado; I am especially fond of Rothko and color blocking  which is very different from Picasso's style. However, this exhibit boasted 43 works and regardless of whatever modern art movement you prefer this exhibit will not fail to impress. This collection contained a series of works inspired by his wife Jacqueline. The whole exhibit will give you a deeper appreciation of Braques and his cubist movement. I can't recommend this gallery enough. Go to it to take a break from all the slot machines and general chaos found in Vegas. Enjoy.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They have an interactive headset feature where as you walk around you can hear a short story and description of each of the beautiful paintings as you are in front of them. The staff could be a bit more \"customer service\" oriented but I guess standing around all day staring at the same paintings does get to you after a while. It does provide a great history of his personal life and his inspirations for each of his works of art.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've been to many museums such as SF MOMA, NY MOMA, LACMA, MOCA, Chicago Art Institute, Musee D' Orsay, Louvre and more.  I've been to BGFA in Bellagio a few times when they had Gaugin, Picasso and the latest, Andy Warhol.\n\nWe got there at 7:30pm and they were closing at 8pm.  We were told we only had 30 minutes - yeah, I figured that much.  I also knew we would only need less than 30 minutes.  This is a teeny tiny gallery so even if I stared at every single piece of art and read the notes about each piece, I wouldn't need 30 minutes! For $13 per local, this place isn't worth it - you're not getting your money's worth at all.  You can see more art in other galleries in other cities for $15.  We were done in 15-20 minutes.  They also don't allow photography. I've taken pictures of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre without a problem...yup, MONA LISA...LOUVRE! Something's not right. The gallery feels so stuffy and humid...might not be the best environment to keep art in.\n\nHowever, the lack of culture and art in this city, I feel obliged to like this gallery since I have no choice.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":1}

I don't go as often as I should but I can and will--well not if history is my guide.\n\nI know the space is small and I realize they charge too much for admission given that fact.  The audio tour wand included with the admission is almost worth the admission price.\n\nThe current exhibit--A Sense of Place:Landscapes from Monet to Hockney is small with a limited number of paintings and other art.  The quality, however, is excellent.  Many of the pieces are on loan from The Boston Museum of Fine Arts.  Some are from the Contemporary Museum in San Diego, and a few pieces are from the MGM Resorts collection.\n\nI didn't have all that much time today, so I did the audio tour and moved quickly through the exhibition.  Since I have the membership for a year, I can go back another time and spend more time studying the individual works and learning more about the artists.\n\nAgain, I know the place is small, but at least we have a fine arts gallery.  With the Guggenheim closing and the West Sahara Library Museum closed, we need something like the BGFA.  It is worth having.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}
